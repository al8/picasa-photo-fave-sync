# picasa-photo-fave-sync
Mark "favorite" photos in picasa3, sync these downsized photos to a selected output directory.

Currently Windows only.

Warning: this is super old hacky code originally from decades ago, slowly updated to work for a specific use case. Goal is to change this and make it actually usable for others :P.

# Dependencies

Depends on a couple tools:

## ImageMagick

https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

Download the portable version, e.g. ImageMagick-7.0.10-28-portable-Q16-x64.zip

## Exif Jpeg header manipulation
